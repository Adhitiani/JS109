Hint 
- first, figure out the data structure 
- figure out how to represent the "#" and the " "
- like the substring, look at how the index changes 


Chessboard
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # # each row = 8 characters
# # # #  each row = 8 characters
 # # # # each row = 8 characters
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.

forEach = convert to while loop, convert to for loop
// Your code here.
